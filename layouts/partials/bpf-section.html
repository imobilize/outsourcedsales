Although this may be true, other powerful factors are at play and are the real driving force behind their success. These factors remain mysteriously unknown to the general public. They are like secret, magic tricks that have a potent effect on the unsuspecting customer. Yet big companies have been knowingly using these spellbinding tactics for many years. Employing these methods has allowed them to gain a large market share and command extraordinary profits. All while their competition fights over the scraps. If you want to create a brand that can thrive in this highly competitive market, it is time to arm yourself with these same weapons of influence. <br><br> READ THIS BOOK NOW TO START GAINING YOUR EDGE!"</p>
